Description: bimergm is used to fit bipartite ERGMs taking the node heterogeneity 
    into account, the estimation is carried out iteratively. For the estimation 
    i.e. prediction of nodal random effects, which counts for nodal heterogeneity, 
    pseudo-likelihood estimation techniques are used, and for the estimation of networks 
    statistics, endogenous or exogenous, MCMC-MLE estimation techniques are adapted, 
    where the random effects are set as offset parameter.
