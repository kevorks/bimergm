Description: bimergm is used to fit bipartite ERGMs taking the node heterogeneity 
    into account, the estimation is carried out iteratively. For the estimation 
    i.e. prediction of nodal random effects, which counts for nodal heterogeneity, 
    we use pseudo-likelihood estimation techniques and for the estimation of networks 
    statistics, endogenous or exogenous, we use MCMC-MLE estimation techniques, 
    where the random effects are set as offset parameter.
